I can tell your love's the kind that'll burn me alive
Cause the way you dance, has set the place on fire
Everybody's watching, you've got 'em mesmerised
You ain't gonna go home alone tonight

All around the world
Lovers have come and gone
All around the world
Whether it's right or wrong

You better get ready, get ready to give it away tonight
You better get ready to give it away

Can't you tell the night is full of mystery
I can see desire burning in your eyes
I know something dangerous is close to me
Someone wild is screaming in the night

All around the world
Lovers are playing games
All around the world
It's driving me insane

You better get ready, get ready to give it away tonight
You better get ready to give it away tonight
You better get ready to give it away

All night, alright, hold tight
Alright, all night, alright

(Solo)

All around the world
Lovers are playing games
All around the world
It's driving me insane

You better get ready, get ready to give it away tonight (x2)
You better get ready to give it away tonight (x2)
Get ready to give it away
Get ready to give it away tonight
