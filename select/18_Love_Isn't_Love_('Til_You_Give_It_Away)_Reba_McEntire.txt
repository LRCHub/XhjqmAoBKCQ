A smile's not a smile till it wrinkles your face a bell's not a bell without ringing
A home's not a home when there's nobody there a song's not a song without singing
Love isn't love till you give it away love isn't love till it's free
Love in your heart wasn't put there to stay
No love isn't love till you give it away
[ Strings ]
You might think love is a treasure to keep a feeling to cherrish and hold
But love is a treasure for people to share you keep it by letting it go
Love isn't love till you give it away...

Love can't survive when it's hidden inside and love was meant to be shared
Love isn't love till you give it away...
